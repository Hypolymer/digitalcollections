# Digital Collections

This framework is the primary display for the WSULS Digital Collections Platform. It uses the Slim Framework (v3), written in PHP. This search and display interface interfaces with Digital Collections infrastructure through our custom API: See [APIRequest class](../src/Services/APIRequest.php) for more info.

Note: Work in-progress.
