# Middlewares

Class Middlewares reside in the Middlewares directory. See each file for an explanation of how they work. Also look at the closure middlewares found in [middleware.php](../middleware.php). CsrfGuard, etc are from Josh Lockhart's [Slim-Extras](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim-Extras) Github repository.
